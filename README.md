# _tdverpy_ - a test-driven versioning tool

This is an implementation of the concepts in https://github.com/abathur/tdver. It's very much an experiment. I am posting it in 2022, but the majority of the code is actually from 2014. My main edits in 2022 are to swap out the Git API, get the broad strokes working, add the .nix expressions, add a demo, and run that demo in GA.

The easiest way to see this in action is to check the CI runs. If you have Nix installed, you can also clone this repo and run `nix-shell` from the root.
